# Lumen — Manual Test Scripts

Tests that need real hardware, third-party software or a human. Each entry
lists steps, the expected result and its last recorded run.

Build the prototypes first: `cargo build --release --workspace` (see
`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for the toolchain).

## M1 · P-ASIO — native ASIO host (`prototypes/asio-probe`)

### MT-ASIO-1 · Enumerate and query every driver safely
1. `target/release/asio-probe list`
2. `target/release/asio-probe query --timeout 15`

**Expected:** every registered driver is listed. Each one is either queried
(channels, names, buffer sizes, rates, clocks) or reported unavailable with
the driver's own message. A hanging or crashing driver is reported as
TIMED OUT or CRASHED and the probe continues.

**Last run (2026-10-05, dev machine):** pass. 7 drivers. Focusrite USB ASIO
and ASIO4ALL queried. Ableton Move and Push, Alpha, Focusrite Thunderbolt
and FlexASIO (misconfigured device) returned clean errors. No timeouts or
crashes.

### MT-ASIO-2 · Stable streaming at the interface's buffer size
1. `target/release/asio-probe stream "Focusrite USB ASIO" --seconds 30`
2. Repeat with `--engine-tracks 64`.

**Expected:** callback count matches duration; 0 sample-position
discontinuities; 0 real-time heap operations; worst callback well under the
period. Output is silent.

**Last run (2026-10-05):** pass. Results in ADR-0006.

### MT-ASIO-3 · Small buffer
`target/release/asio-probe stream "ASIO4ALL v2" --seconds 15 --buffer 64 --engine-tracks 64`

**Expected:** as MT-ASIO-2 at a 64-frame buffer.

**Last run (2026-10-05):** pass (1.45 ms period, worst callback 3.8%).

### MT-ASIO-4 · Driver reset request (needs a human)
1. `target/release/asio-probe stream "Focusrite USB ASIO" --seconds 60`
2. While it runs, open Focusrite Control and change the buffer size (or the
   sample rate).

**Expected:** the probe prints `kAsioResetRequest received: recreating
buffers` and reports a second segment at the new buffer size. No crash and no
hang.

**Last run:** not yet run. Needs a person at the machine.

### MT-ASIO-5 · Hardware removed while streaming (needs a human)
1. Start a 60 s stream on the Focusrite.
2. Unplug the interface's USB cable after about 10 s.

**Expected:** the probe does not crash. It stops receiving callbacks and
reports the reset or error messages the driver sends. (Recovery UX is
designed in M2.)

**Last run:** not yet run.

### MT-ASIO-6 · Driver busy in another application (needs a human)
1. Open another ASIO application (for example Ableton Live) on the Focusrite
   driver and start playback.
2. Run `asio-probe query` and `asio-probe stream "Focusrite USB ASIO" --seconds 10`.

**Expected:** a clear error or shared operation, depending on the driver. No
crash and no hang.

**Last run:** not yet run.
